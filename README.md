# Python CLI File Manager

This is a simple command-line file manager built using Python. It provides basic file and directory management commands, similar to those found in a Unix shell.

## Features

- 📄 Create files with optional content (`touch`)
- 📖 Read contents of a file (`cat`)
- ❌ Delete files (`rm`)
- 📁 Create directories (`mkdir`)
- 🔀 Change the current working directory (`cd`)
- 📂 List files and folders in the current directory (`ls`)
- 🏠 Return to the original starting directory (`home`)
- ❓ Display help for available commands (`help`)
- 🚪 Exit the program safely (`exit`)
- Error handling and clear feedback for most commands

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python file_manager.py
```
